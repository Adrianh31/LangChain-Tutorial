       "'Page: Conifer cone\\nSummary: A conifer cone or pinecone (strobilus, pl.: strobili in formal botanical usage) is a seed-bearing organ on gymnosperm plants. It is usually woody, ovoid to globular, including scales and bracts arranged around a central axis, especially in conifers and cycads. The cone of Pinophyta (conifer clade) contains the reproductive structures. The woody cone is the female cone, which produces plants. The male cone, which produces pollen, is usually herbaceous and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The name \"cone\" derives from Greek konos (pine cone), which also gave name to the geometric cone. The individual plates of a cone are known as scales. The umbo of a conifer cone refers to the first year\\'s growth of a seed scale on the cone, showing up as a protuberance at the end of the two-year-old scale.The male cone (microstrobili or pollen cone) is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species'"
